# (Evolvania)[https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam/rate/307671]

created for the godot-wild-jam

THEME was Evolution.

The idea of the game still stand: a platform in which every character bring some abilities, mating with them will generate their heir that will bring their genetics. Depending on the combination you could at the end collect all the gems (that is the final purpose of the game).

It doesn't really have a "YOU WIN" screen either. Hopefully in future versions

Explore the world and collect all 13 gems. Find a mate as fast as you can, because your lifetime is limited!

You start with 3 lives, but each one has different abilities. Choose the one that suits you, and carry your genetic material with you. When you mate, a new generation is born, combining your abilities with the ones of your partner.

Different abilities are found according to the environment your potential mates live in, and different zones are unlocked by using specific abilities (that's  where the -vania in Evolvania comes from).

(The map is incomplete and the gameplay is very raw, but we hope the prototype is enough to show you the basic idea)
